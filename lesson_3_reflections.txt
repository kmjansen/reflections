# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when working with others to enable easier collaboration
    or when working from mulitple machines. Additionally, using a remote repository can be an
    additional safeguard against catastrophic file loss on a user's local computer.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because one might not want the changes that someone else made on the remote
    repository on their local machine

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a remote clone of a repository on GitHub's servers, a clone
    is a copy of a remote repository into a new local repository, and
    branches are a local clones within the same local repository. One would want
    to use a fork to make an exact copy of someone else's repository to which
    he may edit without affecting the original repository, a clone when copying
    a repository that he may directly edit, and a branch when working on a
    parallel path from the master for experimental or refactoring purposes, or
    to fix bugs without affecting the functional codebase.
