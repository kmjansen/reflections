# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when working with others to enable easier collaboration
or when working from mulitple machines. Additionally, using a remote repository can be an 
additional safeguard against catastrophic file loss on a user's local computer.
